# **YOMAC**  

YOMAC is an innovative e-learning web application designed to enhance the learning experience for both educators and students. With YOMAC, users can create, manage, and engage with educational content seamlessly, offering features that cater to diverse learning needs.  

### **Key Features**  

1. **Backend-Driven Comprehensive Content Management for a Collaborative Learning and Tracking Environment:**  

   - **Top Instructor Privileges:** At the core of the system is a powerful backend infrastructure that empowers each **Top Instructor** with full control over their course content. They can seamlessly perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on **Courses**, **Course Sections**, **Quizzes**, **Contests**, **Assignments**, and **a LiveQA chat session for course**. This backend architecture ensures courses are structured, updated, and managed efficiently, maintaining high-quality standards across the platform.  

   - **Collaborative Teaching with Controlled Access:** The backend system supports role-based access management, allowing Top Instructors to add other instructors to assist in course management. These assisting instructors (non-Top Instructors) operate under predefined restrictions enforced by the backend. For instance, they can propose **quizzes**, **assignments**, and **contests**, but the backend ensures that these proposals are routed to the Top Instructor for approval or rejection. This process is automated and securely handled in the backend to maintain course consistency and quality.  

   - **Interactive Video-Based Q&A:** Under each video, a **Q&A section** is available. Students can post their questions, and the system organizes them by timestamps, relevance, or popularity. Responses from instructors and fellow students are also processed and stored in the backend, allowing learners to revisit these discussions anytime. This static Q&A system complements the **Real-Time LiveQA** feature, providing a well-rounded learning experience.  

   - **Student Progress Tracking and Analytics:** The backend tracks every aspect of a student's journey through the course, including completed sections, quiz scores, submitted assignments, and engagement with the Q&A sections. This data is processed to generate detailed **progress reports and statistical insights**, which are accessible to both students and instructors. The backend also supports data visualization and performance metrics, giving a clear understanding of individual progress and overall course impact.

2. **Two Types of Courses:**  
   - **Public Courses:**  
     - Visible to all users, allowing students to easily explore and enroll.  
   - **Private Courses:**  
     - Accessible only with a unique course code, providing a secure and exclusive classroom-like experience.  

3. **Private Course Extensions:**  
   - Includes all the features of public courses, with additional advanced tools:  
     - **Real-Time Chat:** Students and instructors can engage in discussions with auto-saved messages for uninterrupted communication.  
     - **Livestream Integration:** Host live sessions for lectures, Q&A, or collaborative discussions, bringing an interactive touch to virtual learning using *WebRTC* technology.
     - **Announcemnts:** Course Instructors can make announcemnts for the enrolled students.

4. **User-Centric Design:**  
   - Simplified enrollment process for students.  
   - Dynamic course visibility and privacy options for instructors.  

### **My Role in YOMAC**  
I played a primary role in building YOMAC, handling both backend and some frontend responsibilities:  
- **Backend Development:**  
  - Designed and implemented the entire backend architecture, including APIs, database management, and business logic for the whole project.  
- **Frontend Development:**  
    - Introduced **Redux** to the team and provided guidance on how to use it for state management in the development of the public mode of the project.  
    - Built the **Private Course Extension**, incorporating advanced features such as real-time chat with message-saving functionality and livestream integration.  
    - Assisted the team in integrating APIs with the frontend, ensuring seamless communication between the client and server.  

### **Why YOMAC?**  
YOMAC bridges the gap between traditional and modern learning by empowering educators to create meaningful content and students to access knowledge in a structured, interactive, and inclusive manner. Whether itâ€™s open collaboration through public courses or focused learning via private courses, YOMAC adapts to your educational needs.
